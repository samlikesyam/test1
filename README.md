## üë©üèª About Me

Hi! I'm Sam and I'm currently learning  how to create a README file and how to use Git. Here are a few things about me:
- I'm a Senior Customer Representative at a Software as a Service company and I'm looking to transition into a career in data
- Languages and technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python
- I love learning how to code, I particularly like Python and I'm excited to apply this in a group project!

## üíª My Coding Projects
